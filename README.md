**Currently working only in Italy** since it uses data on gas station updated daily from the MiSE (Mynistry of Economic Development)
along with Google Maps API.

The app offers the ability to search for a path, edit info on the car used to travel (such as average km/l, tank size, etc..) and 
uses this information to retrieve one (or more, for example if the tank size is not enough for the travel) gas station and edit 
the path. The new path is easily openable on Google Maps.
